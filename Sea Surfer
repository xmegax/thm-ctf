Welcome to my first walkthrough on TryHackMe,
I'm mega97, today we have a new room which called sea surfer
Let's start:
first we will check if the machine is pingable or not to do our initial scan using nmap

ping -c 5 10.10.134.126
64 bytes from 10.10.134.126: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=26.5 ms
as we see the machine is pingaple

so let's start our scan with
sudo nmap -sV -O -T5 -vv -oN nmap.log 10.10.134.126 -p-

we got 2 opened ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 63 OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 63 Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))

let's visit the http site to see it and start to gather more information
we got apache default page
let's view page source to see if there anything interresting...we got nothing
lets enumerate the domain for web pages using gobuster
gobuster -u http://10.10.134.126:80/ -w SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt
we got
/.htaccess (Status: 403)
/.htpasswd (Status: 403)
/index.html (Status: 200)
/server-status (Status: 403)
all with 403 code that means it's not accessible
there is something missing
shall we check the get request header of the page to see if there is something useful !
we got X-Backend-Server:seasurfer.thm
this header leaks the hostname
let's edit our /etc/hosts file and add the machineip  seasurfer.thm
then navigate to http://seasurfer/
it worked
let's scan with gobuster again
gobuster -u http://seasurfer.thm/ -w SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt
we got 
/login (Status: 302) that redirects to the ordinary worpress login page
/adminer (Status: 301) directory that redirect us to akind of database login page
after navigation to http://seasurfer.thm/adminer/ we find it's version is Adminer 4.8.1
let's search for exploit for this version, unfortunatly there is no vulns for this version it seems to be updated.
let's continue surfing the web page until we find something interesting........
